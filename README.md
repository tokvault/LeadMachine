## Description:

LeadMachine is a system of workflows built with n8n to scrape, store, manage, and verify lead data. It uses various 3rd party API calls to verify data and is controlled by a central dashboard created in Google Sheets.

**Features:**

- You can try n8n Cloud for free [here](https://n8n.io/?ref=zmy3mdq&utm_source=affiliate). n8n can also be self-hosted with no monthly fee and you can read that documentation [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/)
- Google Sheets dashboard allows the user to scrape leads based on niche, city, and state using the API developed by OpenWeb Ninja found at RapidAPI. You can try the API free by signing up [here.](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/local-business-data)
- The dashboard displays various stats regarding collected leads including total leads, verified mobile numbers, verified emails, social accounts, leads by city, leads by state, leads by niche, and more. Make a copy of the Google Sheet in your personal drive by viewing it [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hRR6B-bJDC53pwdL5AMzoAd-o5KcOoVee3e_C-2wgFs/edit?usp=sharing)
